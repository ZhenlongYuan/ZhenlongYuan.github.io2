# 🧑‍🎨 About Me 
I'm currently pursuing toward the Ph.D. degree in the [Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ict.ac.cn/) (中国科学院计算技术研究所), advised by Zhaoqi Wang (王兆其). 

My research interest includes 3D computer vision (3DCV), medical image and vision-language model (VLM). 
I have published 10+ papers at the top international AI conferences such as AAAI, Pattern Recognition.
If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [yuanzhenlong21b@ict.ac.cn](mailto:yuanzhenlong21b@ict.ac.cn)
